# Cuis-Smalltalk-Projects
Create hierarchical projects similar to those in the original Smalltalk-80 system.

Once you install the Projects package there will be a 'Project' menu entry under the 'Open...' world menu entry. This will create a new unnamed project. When you click on it you will enter the new project. To leave a project select the 'Previous Project' menu entry from the global world menu.

As in the Smalltalk-80 system, projects can be nested inside each other. However unlike Smalltalk-80, projects are not associated with a change-set.

You can increase the size of the project morph to see more details of the project or decrease its size to make it occupy less space.
